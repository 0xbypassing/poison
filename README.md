# Example usage:
## Example command:
```
./poison.py -u 'http://127.0.0.1/file.php?file=' -e 'id' -p src/payloads.txt -w src/small.txt
```
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
```
-u 'http://127.0.0.1/file.php?file=' # URL for poison the log
```

```
-e 'id' # Command to execute (In this time, command is id) (this option can be used for rev. shell)
```

```
-p src/payloads.txt # list of paylods during the poisoning
```

```
-w src/small.txt # wordlist using the search for available log's file
```
# ToDo list:
-   [x] Add the function with command execution
-   [x] Add the support of wordlist's
-   [ ] Add different injection endpoints (Headers)
-   [ ] Interactive shell 
-   [ ] Add the function for RFI
